   Time: 1 hour
   Notes: Use generated seed instead of static value of 9
   Results:
    - vs previous run best, 128 sims: 73-27
    - vs greedy, 128 sims: 98-2
    - _promoted as new baseline_

7. Run #7 - 2026/06/30
   Platform: Kaggle (GPU)
   Iterations: 60
   Time: 2 hours 11 minutes
   Notes:
   Results:
    - vs previous run best, 128 sims: 83-17
    - vs greedy, 128 sims: 99-1
    - _promoted as new baseline_

8. Run #8 - 2026/06/30
   Platform: Kaggle (GPU)
   Iterations: 40
   Time: 1 hour 25 minutes
   Notes:
   Results:
    - vs previous run best, 128 sims: 69-31
    - vs greedy, 128 sims: 100-0
    - _promoted as new baseline_

9. Run #9 - 2026/06/30
   Platform: Kaggle (GPU)
   Iterations: 20
   Time: 45 minutes
   Notes: Increased history_iters to 20, increased epochs to 5
   Results:
    - vs previous run best, 128 sims: 53-47
    - vs greedy, 128 sims: 100-0
    - Promoted tentatively, but on further testing later it seems at best it's even with run 8, or even a bit weaker

10. Run #10 - 2026/06/30
    Platform: Kaggle (GPU)
    Iterations: 1 hour 38 minutes
    Time: 1 hour 45 minutes
    Notes: increased epochs to 6
    Results:
    - vs previous run best, 128 sims: 67-33
    - vs greedy, 128 sims: 100-0
    - against run 8 it went 56-44 and 52-48 in two 100 game matches, so not significantly better as the record against run 9 might suggest
    - _promoted as new baseline_
